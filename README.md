### About me:
UofT CS '25, currently interning at Hitachi Rail as an ITV Specialist. I really enjoy low-level programming, such as using CUDA to program NVIDIA GPUs (check out pixelify :D). I'm also currently learning reverse-engineering, and in my spare time I'm into weightlifting, learning guitar, and playing with my dog.
